## Introduction

> **Turing Front-end App Challenge template** is an e-commerce application template built using React that enables users shop for goods in the plaform. To complete this challenge, you need to implement all the requirement in the frontend challenge doc. You can modify the design to suit your purpose, but ensure you use all our default predefined Id and classes.
Comments are added to the top of most of the component file which serve as a guide to what is expected from the finished product.

The App has been built using React.

The core libraries are as follows:

* React
* Redux
* Redux Saga
* React Material UI

The app uses and advanced redux structure. All Network calls go via redux and redux saga. The global state is then updated. All components simply listen to the state or send a request for data. The UI is state driven. The full redux store can be found in the "store" folder under the "src directory".

The UI is based primarily on Material UI. Tailwind CSS is used for grids and responsiveness. Other thatn that, custom styling is used. The theming is quite an advanced structure in itself. The Layout and Theme is selected based on the route. This can be seen in th "layouts" directory in the "src" directory. All Icons are SVG or Font Icons so scaling should not be an issue.

The backend APIs can be found in this link: [API](https://github.com/zandoan/turing-frontend)
